# Commerce Widgets

Liferay Commerce ships with a wide range of widgets you'll use to construct your
site. This section provides a convenient overview in one place.

## Account Management

The Account Management widget allows buyers, sales agents and administrators to
manage their accounts without having to access to the Liferay control panel.

Administrators can view a list of all accounts, create new accounts, existing
accounts, relate accounts to organizations, add members to accounts and manage
the roles and profile data of account members. Different roles, e.g. sales
agents or buyers, can be given fewer permissions.

## Cart Widgets

The **Cart** widget displays the cart’s current contents. It includes controls
to change the quantity of the products it holds, or to delete them entirely.

The **Cart Summary** widget displays the total price of all items in the cart,
including a checkout button. It doesn’t list the cart’s contents.

The **Mini Cart** displays the cart’s contents and includes a checkout button,
but has no controls to edit its content. Instead, it displays an Edit Cart
button that links to the Cart widget. Because of this link, the Cart Mini widget
can’t function unless a page containing a Cart Content widget is present.

## Category Content

The Category Content widget identifies a category page to other widgets, and
selects content appropriate to the context.

For example, when a user selects a category using *Category Navigation*, the
navigation widget finds the first page with a Category Content widget and
displays it. Category Content then displays appropriate content based on the
category selected: for example, by the default the widget will desplay whatever
image is assigned to the category in (set in *Site Menu* &rarr;
*Categorization*)

If you place a Search Results widget on the same page, Category Content will
point the search widget toward products in the selected category.

## Checkout

The checkout widget handles purchase process. Without any configuration, the
Checkout widget features a four-step process: shipping address, billing address,
order summary and order confirmation. When you configure 
[Shipping Methods](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/shipping-methods)
and 
[Payment Methods](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/payment-methods),
additional steps are automatically added to the process.

Custom checkout steps can be added using the 
[custom checkout step extension point](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/custom-checkout-step).

## Commerce Categories Navigation

The Commerce Categories Navigation widget works with [Category
Content](#category-content) facilitate navigation to product category pages.

Select a vocabulary on the widget's configuration screen. All of the categories
in that vocabulary will be displayed by the widget as links to category pages.
When a user selects one of those links, that selection is provided as context to
the Category Content widget, which then displays the desired category.

## Orders

### Orders

The Order Content widget displays a list of orders that have been placed. Click
on an order to display additional information about the transaction, with an
option to reorder.

### Open Carts

The Pending Orders widget displays orders that have not been submitted to the
seller. The cart's current contents are included as a pending order, as well as
any orders that are in the process of a buyer-side workflow.

## Coupon Code Entry

If you've created a discount that requires the entry of a coupon code, then
buyers who know the code will need something to do with it. Drop a coupon code
widget onto a page--sharing a page with Cart or Pending Orders is logical, but
you can put it anywhere a buyer will have access prior to completing an order.

See
[Discounts](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/discounts)
for more on coupon codes.

## Product Comparison Table 

Displays the information for different products side-by-side. The Product
Comparsion Bar is used to add products to the table.

### Product Comparison Bar

When placed on a product page, this widget modifies the Product Detail widget to
include a *Compare* button. Clicking it adds the current product to the compare
products widget. Clicking the *Compare* button on the Compare Products Mini
widget navigates to the Compare Products widget and displays selected products
side-by-side.

## Product Details

The Product Details widget displays information about a product.When a user
clicks on a link to a product page, the widget retrieves the appropriate content
from the catalog and displays it on the page. 

Product Details works much like Category Content (see above). Rather than
forcing you to configure a unique page for every product, the widget allows you
to use a single page where the widget simply reads the current context to
determine what product's information should be displayed.

## Product Downloads

For Virtual Products

## Product Publisher

The Product Publisher simply displays a list of products. You can select
products manually, or provide criteria so Commerce can make the selection for
you.

-   Dynamic: Publish products associated with certain categories and or tags.
From the Configuration screen, open the *Filter* section and specify what
categories or tags you want to publish or exclude from publishing.

-   dataSource: Select a criteria that will be applied depending on the current
-   context.


## Product Subscriptions

For the buyer to track his subscriptions

## Search Results

To be merged with Search's search results? For now, it only finds products

### Option Facet

Group with search results

### Specification Facet


## Shipments

## Wish List Contents

Used for editing and viewing the content of a single wishlist. It looks like the
typcial use case is to put both of these widgets side-by-side on a page.

## Wish Lists

A wishlist isn't so much a wishlist as a list of products that a buyer might
want to track.

The My Commerce Wish List widget manages wish lists--whatever wish lists you
have access to. If you're an administrator, that's all of them.
